# Music School Management System (MSMS) - PST4
## Overview
This project represents the development of the Music School Management System (MSMS) from a text-based console application to a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Streamlit. The system incorporates Object-Oriented Programming principles to facilitate efficient management of students, teachers, courses, and attendance.

## Features

- Allows users to view the daily schedule of courses and lessons
- Utilizes JSON for data storage, ensuring that information is retained between sessions

## How to Run
- Ensure you have Python 3.9 and Streamlit installed
- Navigate to the project directory
- Enter *streamlit run main.py* in the terminal
- Follow the on-screen menu instructions

## Design Choices
- Implemented Object-Oriented Programming architecture for better scalability
- Used Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for separation of concerns
- JSON format chosen for data persistence for simplicity and readability
- Added input validation for all operations
- The GUI provides immediate feedback for user actions, improving user experience

## Future Improvements
- Payments section for managing student fees
